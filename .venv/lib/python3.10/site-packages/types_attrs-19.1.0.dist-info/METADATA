## Typing stubs for attrs

This is an auto-generated PEP 561 type stub package for `attrs` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `attrs`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/attrs. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `attrs` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 18.2.0. Please uninstall the `types-attrs`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `746db19c3f199a7173f72e1598b8adad199a2f43`.
